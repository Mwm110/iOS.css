iOS.css
=======

**Update:** Due to the huge design changes in iOS 7, this project became redundant. You should check out [Framework7](http://www.idangero.us/framework7/) for an alternative way of developing HTML5 based applications for iOS 7.


Demo: http://www.raffael.me/iOS.css/

iOS.css is a set of JavaScript and CSS files, that enable web developers to make use of pixel-perfect imitations of native iOS user interface elements in web applications.

**Yet another?**
Yes, pixel-perfect. Lightweight using CSS3.

**Fully cross-platform?**
Of course not, it only has to run on Mobile Safari.

**Dependencies?**
jQuery for DOM manipulation.

**License?**
MIT License.

The project is growing over time, so far the following iOS UI elements have been added:

* Checkboxes
* List Views
* Black Navigation Bars
* Default Header
